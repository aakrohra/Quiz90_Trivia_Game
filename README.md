This repository is a fork of https://github.com/Aref-Mal/Quiz90/ after completion. My individual contributions were key input functionality, quiz access from API, and custom quiz creation. My team contributions were assisting with quiz playthrough logic, the README, and UIs (creating views and connecting them to each other). Detailed contributions can be found in the commit history, and in the issues tab of the original repo.
